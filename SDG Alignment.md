## SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being

### SDG Objective
Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

### Alignment with the Project

Emergency medical response time plays a critical role in saving lives. Delays in ambulance arrival can significantly increase mortality rates during accidents, cardiac arrests, and other medical emergencies.

This project directly supports **SDG 3** by:
- Reducing ambulance response time using shortest-path algorithms.
- Ensuring faster access to emergency medical care.
- Improving survival chances by optimizing ambulance routing decisions.
- Supporting healthcare systems with intelligent decision-making tools.

By minimizing travel time and selecting the best ambulance, the system enhances the effectiveness of emergency healthcare services, thereby promoting better health outcomes.

## SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

### SDG Objective
Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

### Alignment with the Project

In densely populated cities, traffic congestion and inefficient routing can delay emergency services. This project focuses on making cities safer by enabling faster emergency responses.

The project supports **SDG 11** through:
- Improving emergency preparedness and response efficiency.
- Supporting smart city initiatives through intelligent transportation systems.
- Reducing traffic-related delays for emergency vehicles.
- Enhancing public safety by ensuring timely medical assistance.

By integrating algorithm-based routing into urban emergency systems, the project contributes to safer and more resilient city environments.

## SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

### SDG Objective
Reduce inequality within and among countries.

### Alignment with the Project

Access to timely emergency healthcare should not depend on geographic location or traffic conditions. This project promotes fairness in emergency response.

The project aligns with **SDG 10** by:
- Ensuring equal access to emergency services across different city areas.
- Reducing disparities in response times between central and remote locations.
- Supporting data-driven decision-making rather than manual or biased selection.

By optimizing ambulance dispatch for all locations, the system helps reduce inequality in healthcare access.

## SDG 13: Climate Action (Indirect Contribution)

### SDG Objective
Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

### Alignment with the Project

Although not directly focused on environmental protection, the project indirectly contributes to climate action by improving route efficiency.

Indirect benefits include:
- Reduced fuel consumption due to shorter and optimized routes.
- Lower carbon emissions from emergency vehicles.
- Efficient utilization of transportation resources.

Optimized routing minimizes unnecessary travel, supporting environmentally responsible operations.
