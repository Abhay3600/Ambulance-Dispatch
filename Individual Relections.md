## 👤 Individual Reflection – Abhay

Working on this project helped me deeply understand the importance of algorithm selection in real-world applications. Initially, algorithms such as Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, and Bellman–Ford seemed purely theoretical. However, while applying them to the ambulance dispatch problem, I realized how directly algorithm efficiency impacts human lives.

I primarily focused on analyzing **shortest path algorithms**, especially Dijkstra’s algorithm. Through this, I learned why non-negative edge weights are a critical assumption and how violating this condition affects correctness. I also understood the importance of **time complexity** in real-time systems. An algorithm that is correct but slow can be dangerous in emergency situations.

This project strengthened my understanding of:
- Graph modeling of real-world problems
- Trade-offs between optimality and performance
- Why greedy strategies work effectively in certain scenarios

Overall, the project showed me that algorithms are not just academic tools but powerful solutions that drive intelligent systems. It improved my analytical thinking and helped me appreciate the real-life impact of algorithm design.

## 👤 Individual Reflection – Pranav

This project significantly enhanced my understanding of **algorithm analysis and comparison**. I studied multiple algorithms such as Bellman–Ford, Floyd–Warshall, and Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms, and evaluated why many of them are unsuitable for real-time ambulance routing.

I learned that choosing an algorithm is not only about solving a problem, but about solving it **efficiently under constraints**. For example, Floyd–Warshall provides all-pairs shortest paths, but its high time complexity makes it impractical for large city networks. This helped me understand the importance of scalability.

Key learnings from this project include:
- Importance of asymptotic analysis in decision-making
- Understanding why brute force approaches fail in real-world systems
- Learning how algorithm constraints affect system feasibility

This project helped me connect theoretical analysis with system performance and reinforced the role of efficient algorithms in critical applications such as emergency response systems.

## 👤 Individual Reflection – Vishwas

Through this project, I gained a clear understanding of how **greedy algorithms and optimization techniques** play a crucial role in intelligent systems. My focus was on ambulance selection logic and the use of greedy decision-making once shortest paths were computed.

I learned that a greedy choice, when supported by a correct underlying algorithm, can lead to globally optimal solutions. This was especially evident in selecting the ambulance with the minimum response time. I also studied the role of **priority queues** and how they improve performance in shortest path computation.

Important insights gained include:
- How greedy algorithms improve efficiency without sacrificing correctness
- The role of data structures in optimizing algorithm performance
- The importance of combining algorithms to solve complex problems

This project helped me realize that algorithm design is about smart decision-making, not just coding. It strengthened my problem-solving skills and showed how algorithmic efficiency directly affects system reliability and effectiveness.
