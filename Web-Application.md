## 🌐 Web Application Demonstration

To complement the algorithmic design of the project, a **web-based interface** was developed to visually demonstrate the concept of intelligent ambulance dispatch and route optimization.

### 🔍 Purpose of the Web Application

The web application serves as a **conceptual and visual demonstration** of how the selected algorithms work in a real-world scenario. It helps in understanding the flow of emergency response from incident reporting to ambulance dispatch.

The application demonstrates:
- Representation of city locations and ambulance positions
- Selection of the nearest ambulance
- Visualization of route-based decision-making
- Practical relevance of shortest-path and greedy algorithms

### ⚙️ Relation to Algorithm Design

The web application aligns directly with the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** component of the project:

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** is used conceptually to compute the shortest travel time between locations in a weighted road network.
- **Greedy Selection Algorithm** is applied to choose the ambulance with the minimum response time.
- The application visually reinforces why algorithm efficiency is critical in time-sensitive emergency scenarios.

Although the web application is a simulation, it reflects the **algorithmic logic and decision-making process** used in the backend design of the system.
